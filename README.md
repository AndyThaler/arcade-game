 INTRODUCTION
 ------------

 The *arcade-game-project* is the 4^th project in the Front End Webdevelopment-Nanodegree program and recreates one of our favorite games from our childhood.

The player must avoid enemies while walking over a dangerous road to get to the goal(water). Every time the player walks through the level without hitting an enemy, the score increases. As soon as he/she collides, the score will be set to zero again and the high score is saved. To increase the difficulty, the player can pick up *gems* to have a second score level next to the walk throughs.
